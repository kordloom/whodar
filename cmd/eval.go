// newEvalCmd builds the eval command, which measures the current index and

//
// It is hidden because it answers a question about whodar rather than about the
// organization whodar was pointed at, so it belongs to whoever is changing the
// ranking rather than to whoever is using the tool.

The score is agreement: how often the owner an organization declared for an area
is also the person whodar says leads it. Read it alongside the numbers under it,
because a disagreement has three different causes and only one of them is a bug.
An owner with no recorded work anywhere is usually an identity that was never
joined. An owner who works elsewhere but never in their own area is paper
ownership, and whodar is probably right. An owner merely out-worked in their own
area is the arguable case.

Save a measurement before a change and compare after it. Two runs are only
compared when they cover the same sources, since adding one moves every number
here for reasons that have nothing to do with quality.

  whodar eval --save before.json
