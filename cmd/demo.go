Point it at a repository you already have and it reads that repository's git
history and opens on what it found: the directories the work rests on, and the
ones resting on a single person. Every name is checkable against the same git
log, which is the point of running it on your own code rather than on a sample.

  whodar demo --repo .

With no --repo it builds a simulated company instead. The simulation covers
all eight sources, so identity joins, recency, confidence, and feedback all
behave as they would on real data, but nobody can check it against anything.

Either way nothing is fetched from the network and no credentials are needed.
Nothing is written outside a temporary directory, discarded when the demo stops.

To try cloud AI on the sample data, export a provider key (such as
WHODAR_ANTHROPIC_KEY) and add --policy redacted. Only do this for a demo you keep
to yourself: the demo serves with no token, so a publicly reachable one with a key
set becomes an open relay to your paid account.`,
