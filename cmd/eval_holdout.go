		Long: `Build an index from history up to a cutoff, ask who each place rests on
knowing only that, then read the work that came afterwards and see who was
right.

Every other measurement here describes a history whodar has already read.
This one hides the answer: nothing after the cutoff reaches the index, and a
departure risk is a claim about the future, so this is the shape of
measurement that claim deserves.

The naive prediction, the past window's top committers, is scored on the same
directories from the same evidence. Where the two agree the run says nothing
about either, so the disagreements are reported separately.

Examples:
  whodar eval holdout --repo ~/src/kubernetes
  whodar eval holdout --repo ~/src/prometheus --cutoff-days 540`,
