// about "time off" finds the person the index knows for "vacation". Groups are
// deliberately conservative: a wrong synonym silently hands answers to the wrong
// person, so a term only belongs here when the equivalence holds anywhere a
// workplace would use it. Multi-word members are detected as adjacent words in
// the question; only single words can be added to a search, since the index
