// TestWhatEachSourceIsWorth measures whether folding more tools together
// actually answers better, which the product's whole pitch assumes and nothing
// had ever checked. It builds the same company from growing subsets of its
// sources and asks the same questions of each.
//
// What it found, and what to expect when it is run again:
//
//   - Git alone answers 0.914, from 43 people. The ranking works on evidence of
//     work, without any source stating who owns what.
//   - Adding GitHub, Jira, Confluence, and PagerDuty moves precision NOT AT ALL.
//     They agree with git rather than adding to it.
//   - Slack takes it to 1.000, and takes the index from 43 people to 220. That
//     is the whole shape of the result: SOURCES BUY COVERAGE, NOT PRECISION.
//     Most people never appear in a commit, and a source that reaches them is
//     what puts them in the index to be found at all.
//   - CODEOWNERS and org-csv then add nothing, being already saturated.
//
// One caveat this test exists to keep visible: the generated org-csv carries a
// topics column naming exactly what each person owns, which is this gauntlet's
// own answer key. Put it first and a lone spreadsheet scores 0.909. That is why
// it is ordered last here, and why any future ablation has to account for it.
