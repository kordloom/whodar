// whodar is itself a fact about the company, so queries are reduced to their
// shape and every name, address, and message stays home. The one free-text
// field is the comments the user typed as feedback, carried verbatim because
// they were written to be read by someone fixing the product, and because the
// user reads the whole file before it goes anywhere.
