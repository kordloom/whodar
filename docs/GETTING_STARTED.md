# Getting started with whodar

This guide takes you from nothing to a working setup: install the tool, index a
source, and ask "who do I talk to about X" from the terminal or a browser.

In a hurry to wire in one tool? [CONNECT.md](CONNECT.md) has a short copy-paste
recipe for each source (Slack, GitHub, Jira, Confluence, PagerDuty, git), with
the exact credential to create and how to verify it worked. This guide is the
fuller walkthrough with the concepts behind it.

## What whodar does

You give whodar your work data (an org chart, a Slack workspace) and it builds a
local, searchable map of who knows what and which channel to ask in. You then
ask a plain-language question and get a ranked list of people and channels, with
a short reason for each. It works without any model. If you have a local model
through Ollama, it can also write a one-line recommendation.

Everything stays on your machine by default. Nothing is uploaded unless you
explicitly change the policy.

## Requirements

- Go 1.26 or newer to build from source.
- Optional: a Slack bot token if you want to index Slack.
- Optional: Ollama if you want the LLM answer mode.

## Install

Install with Homebrew. Newer Homebrew requires trusting a third-party tap once
before it will install from it:

    brew trust kordloom/tap
    brew install kordloom/tap/whodar

Or build from source, which needs Go 1.26 or newer:

    git clone https://github.com/kordloom/whodar.git
    cd whodar
    go build -o whodar .
    mkdir -p ~/bin && mv whodar ~/bin/

Check it runs:

    whodar version

The examples below use `whodar`. From a source checkout without installing, use
`go run .` from the repository instead.

## Verify a download

Every release is signed. To check a prebuilt binary from the releases page before
you run it, download `checksums.txt`, `checksums.txt.bundle`, and `cosign.pub`
alongside your archive, then:

    cosign verify-blob \
      --key cosign.pub \
      --bundle checksums.txt.bundle \
      --new-bundle-format \
      checksums.txt
    shasum -a 256 -c checksums.txt --ignore-missing

The first command proves the checksum file is the one we signed; the second
proves your archive matches it. Homebrew and `go install` need no manual step.

## Try it in sixty seconds

The fastest look is the demo: a simulated company indexed across all eight
sources and served in the web UI, no credentials needed.

    whodar demo

It opens a browser on an answered question. Click a name for details, try
"who owns terraform", vote on a result. Sample data only; it is discarded
when the demo stops.

For the command-line loop, the repository ships a small example org chart:

    whodar index --source org-csv --file examples/people.csv
    whodar ask --pretty "who do I talk to about billing retries"

You should see a ranked list of people, each with a score and the reason it
matched, such as "retries (topic)" or "billing (team)". That is the whole loop:
index a source, then ask.

Adding the rest of your tools is the same loop. For a guided setup that validates
the credential and runs the first index, run `whodar connect`; the sections below
are the manual path.

## Index your own org chart

whodar reads a CSV with a header row. Column order does not matter and the
header names are matched loosely, so "Job Title" and "role" both map to title.
Recognized columns:

| Column  | Also accepts                         | Meaning                         |
| ------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| name    | full name, employee, person          | Display name                    |
| email   | mail, email address                  | Used to merge with other sources |
| title   | job title, role                      | Job title                       |
| team    | department, dept, group              | Team name                       |
| org     | organization, division, business unit | Organization name              |
| manager | manager email, reports to            | Manager identifier              |
| topics  | skills, tags, expertise              | Semicolon-separated topics      |

A row needs at least a name or an email. Topics are split on semicolons by
default. A minimal file looks like this:

    name,email,title,team,topics
    Angela Malone,angela@corp.com,Staff Engineer,Payments,billing;retries

Index it:

    whodar index --source org-csv --file /path/to/your/people.csv

## Index Slack

Slack is the strongest source, because it shows which channels exist, what they
are about, and who is active on each topic. There are two ways in: a workspace
export file, which needs no app and no token, or a bot token that can also
re-read history on a schedule.

### The no-token way: a workspace export

A workspace admin can download an export zip at Settings and administration,
Workspace settings, Import/Export Data. Index it directly:

    whodar index --source slack-export --file export.zip --episodes

Nothing touches the network. Public channels are read by default,
`--include-private` reads the private channels a corporate export contains,
and direct messages are never read. This is also the path when someone hands
you an export to analyze rather than access to the workspace itself.

### Create a Slack app and token

1. Go to https://api.slack.com/apps and choose Create New App, then From
   scratch. Pick your workspace.
2. Open OAuth and Permissions. Under Bot Token Scopes add: `channels:read`,
   `channels:history`, `users:read`, and `users:read.email` (add `channels:join`
   to let `--slack-join` self-join public channels). To index private
   channels as well, also add `groups:read` and `groups:history`.
3. Install the app to the workspace and copy the Bot User OAuth Token. It starts
   with `xoxb-`.
4. Export it. whodar reads the token only from the environment, never a flag:

       export WHODAR_SLACK_TOKEN=xoxb-your-token

### Run the index

    whodar index --source slack

By default this reads public channels and the last 180 days of history, capped
at 5000 messages per channel. A bot can only read the history of channels it has
joined. Invite it by hand (`/invite @whodar`) to the channels that matter, or
add the `channels:join` scope and pass `--slack-join` to have it join every
public channel itself, so a whole workspace indexes without manual invites; it
posts a join notice in each channel it enters, and private channels still need
an invite. Unreadable channels are skipped with a warning, not fatal. Tune the
depth:

    whodar index --source slack --since-days 90 --max-messages 2000

To include private channels the token can read:

    whodar index --source slack --include-private

### What gets stored

Message text is tokenized and kept in the local index only, alongside who posted
about what. The token itself is never written to disk and never logged. Nothing
is sent to any third party.

## Ask questions

    whodar ask "who owns billing retries"

At a terminal you get a readable, colored answer. Piped or redirected, you get
JSON on stdout, so you can feed it to other tools. Add `--pretty` to indent that
JSON, `--json` to force JSON at a terminal, or `--human` to force the readable
form through a pipe. Useful flags:

- `--limit N` caps results per section (default 5).
- `--mode keyword` (default) ranks with no model.
- `--mode llm` adds a local model. See the next section.

The answer has two sections. People are who to talk to. Channels are where to
ask, each with its most active members for that topic.

Each keyword-mode result carries a `strength` from zero to one: how much of
the question matched, scaled by how strong the match is. It is deterministic
scoring, not a probability, which is why it is not called a confidence. An explicit topic
counts as proof, a job title slightly less, a passing mention in chat half.
The web UI and the Slack bot show it as strong, moderate, or weak, so a
least-bad answer never dresses up as a sure one.

## Confirm or correct answers

When an answer is right, say so; when it is wrong, say that too. Votes adjust
future rankings for that question and its close variants:

    whodar feedback record "billing retries" --person alice@corp.com --helpful
    whodar feedback record "billing retries" --channel payments --not-helpful --comment "bot answers there now"

Review or undo what has been taught, and tune how hard votes move ranking:

    whodar feedback list --pretty
    whodar feedback clear --person alice@corp.com
    whodar ask --feedback high "billing retries"

The web UI has the same buttons on every result. Votes live in
`feedback.json` next to the index, separate on purpose: re-indexing rebuilds
the graph but keeps what people taught it. Boosted or lowered results say so
in their reasons, and a few votes adjust ranking without ever burying the
underlying evidence.

## LLM mode

LLM mode retrieves candidates with the index, then asks a local model to rank
them and write a short recommendation. The model only ever sees the retrieved
candidates, so it cannot invent a person or a channel.

1. Install Ollama from https://ollama.com and start it.
2. Pull a model:

       ollama pull llama3.1

3. Ask:

       whodar ask --mode llm "who do I talk to about billing retries"
       whodar ask --mode llm --model qwen2.5 "where do I ask about kafka"

Ollama runs on your machine, so LLM mode is allowed under the default strict
policy. Pointing `--ollama-url` at a non-local host counts as leaving the
machine and is refused unless the policy permits it.

## Cloud models (Claude, Gemini, OpenAI, and compatible servers)

By default nothing leaves the machine. If you explicitly opt in, llm mode can
use a cloud model instead of Ollama:

    export WHODAR_ANTHROPIC_KEY=...
    whodar ask --mode llm --provider anthropic --policy redacted "who owns billing"

    export WHODAR_GEMINI_KEY=...
    whodar ask --mode llm --provider gemini --policy redacted "who owns billing"

    export WHODAR_OPENAI_KEY=...
    whodar ask --mode llm --provider openai --policy redacted "who owns billing"

The policy decides what the model sees. Under `--policy redacted`, the
question goes out as you typed it, people leave as anonymized numbered roles
(title, team, and matched query terms), and channels leave as numbered
matched terms, with no names, no emails, no channel names, and no message
text. The question is the one part you control: if you type a person's name
into it, that name goes to the model. The model returns numbers, whodar maps
them back, and the summary is written locally. Redacted egress is limited to
the known provider hosts, so a remote `--openai-url` needs `--policy open`.
Under `--policy open`, candidates go as-is. Under the default strict policy,
cloud providers are refused, and a locked org policy can pin that permanently.

The `openai` provider speaks the common chat-completions format, so
`--openai-url` also points it at local servers like LM Studio or vLLM; a local
URL needs no policy opt-in at all. Keys are read only from the environment and
are never logged or stored.

## Semantic search (Meaning mode in the web UI)

Keyword search matches words. Semantic search matches meaning, so "who handles
failed payments" can find the person tagged with "billing retries" even with no
shared word. It uses a local embedding model through Ollama.

1. Pull an embedding model:

       ollama pull nomic-embed-text

2. Build the index with embeddings:

       whodar index --source org-csv --file examples/people.csv --embed

3. Search by meaning, or let the LLM use semantic retrieval:

       whodar ask --mode semantic "who handles failed payments"
       whodar ask --mode llm "who handles failed payments"

Embeddings are stored in the index. The semantic mode ranks by them directly,
and the llm mode uses them to retrieve candidates before the model ranks and
summarizes. Set the model with --embed-model. The embedder runs locally, so it
is allowed under the strict policy.

## Web UI

Prefer a search box to the terminal:

    whodar serve

Open http://127.0.0.1:8765, type a question, and pick Keyword, Meaning, or
AI. Picking AI reveals a provider choice (local Ollama, Claude, ChatGPT, or
Gemini) with live readiness hints saying what each needs. The sidebar also
browses everything indexed: people, channels, teams, and topics, each
filterable, and clicking a topic asks about it.

### Serving with AI enabled

An amber dot on a provider means it needs something; its tooltip says what.
The recipes:

Ollama (private, everything stays on this machine, allowed under the default
strict policy):

    # install from ollama.com, then:
    ollama pull llama3.1
    whodar serve

Claude, ChatGPT, or Gemini (cloud): export the provider's key and start the
server with a policy that permits cloud egress, since the default strict
policy keeps everything local:

    export WHODAR_ANTHROPIC_KEY=...   # or WHODAR_OPENAI_KEY / WHODAR_GEMINI_KEY
    whodar serve --policy redacted

Redacted sends the model only your question and anonymized numbered
candidates; `--policy open` sends full candidate detail. Keys are read only
from the environment and are never typed into the browser. The provider
choice applies per question, and keyword mode keeps working no matter what.
The same flags work on `whodar demo` if you want to try cloud AI against the
sample company first.

### Meaning mode

Meaning mode matches by meaning instead of exact words, so "failed payments"
can find the person tagged "billing retries". It needs the index built once
with `--embed`; see the Semantic search section below for the two commands. The
server binds to localhost only, so it is not reachable from the network. Stop
it with Ctrl-C; it shuts down cleanly. Change the address with `--addr`;
binding beyond localhost requires `WHODAR_SERVE_TOKEN`, and every request
must then carry the token. See docs/DEPLOY.md for the token flow.

## Claude Code and other agents (MCP)

Let an agent ask whodar mid-conversation. The MCP server speaks stdio, so
registration is one line:

    claude mcp add whodar -- whodar mcp

For Claude Desktop, add this under `mcpServers` in
`claude_desktop_config.json`:

    {"whodar": {"command": "whodar", "args": ["mcp"]}}

The agent gets four tools: `whodar_ask` (ranked people and channels with
reasons and match strength, keyword or semantic), `whodar_recall` (the past
conversations one person took part in), `whodar_person` (a full profile),
and `whodar_directory` (browse people, channels, teams, or topics). There is no llm mode over MCP on purpose: the calling agent is
already a model, so it reads the ranked candidates itself.

One thing to be clear-eyed about: answers flow to whichever agent you wire
this into, and on to that agent's model. Registering the server is the
opt-in.

## Slack bot

Let your team ask whodar from Slack directly. They mention the bot in a channel
or send it a direct message, and the bot replies in place. Adding `--llm` to a
message uses the model for that answer, and `--keyword` forces the fast path.

### Scopes and events

In addition to the read scopes from the Slack section, add the bot scopes
`chat:write`, `app_mentions:read`, `im:history`, and `im:read`. Under Event
Subscriptions, subscribe the bot to `app_mention` and `message.im`.

### The /whodar slash command

Ask from anywhere without mentioning the bot:

    /whodar who owns billing retries

In the app config, open Slash Commands and create `/whodar`. Over Socket
Mode it just works; the request URL field can hold any placeholder. Over the
Events API, point the request URL at `https://your-host/slack/commands`; the
same signing secret verifies it. The answer arrives through Slack's response
URL, visible in the channel, and the `--llm`/`--keyword` hints work in the
command text too.

### Socket Mode (no public URL)

Best for a laptop or an internal host. Enable Socket Mode, create an app-level
token that starts with `xapp-` with the `connections:write` scope, then run:

    export WHODAR_SLACK_TOKEN=xoxb-...
    export WHODAR_SLACK_APP_TOKEN=xapp-...
    whodar bot --transport socket

### Events API (public endpoint)

Best for a hosted deployment. Point the Slack request URL at
https://your-host/slack/events and run:

    export WHODAR_SLACK_TOKEN=xoxb-...
    export WHODAR_SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET=...
    whodar bot --transport events --addr 0.0.0.0:8766

The events transport verifies the Slack request signature and rejects requests
with an old timestamp.

### Default answer mode

By default the bot answers with the keyword resolver. Set `--mode llm` to make
the model the default, in which case Ollama must run on the bot's host. Either
way, a user overrides per message with a trailing `--llm` or `--keyword`.

## GitHub, Jira, and Confluence

Index code, tickets, and wiki pages to learn who works on what.

GitHub needs a token in WHODAR_GITHUB_TOKEN with repository read access:

    export WHODAR_GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp-...
    whodar index --source github --repo your-org/your-repo
    whodar index --source github --github-org your-org --github-emails

It reads contributors, pull request authors, reviewers, assignees, labels and
titles, non-pull-request issues, repository topics, and CODEOWNERS, weighted by
how much each person works on a topic.

Jira needs a site URL and an API token, created at id.atlassian.com:

    export WHODAR_JIRA_URL=https://your-site.atlassian.net
    export WHODAR_JIRA_EMAIL=you@example.com
    export WHODAR_JIRA_TOKEN=...
    whodar index --source jira --jira-project SEC --jira-project OPS

It reads issue assignees and reporters, weighted by components, labels, summary
words, and project. Use --jira-jql for a custom query. When emails are visible,
these people merge with Slack and the org chart by email.

Confluence uses the same Atlassian site and token as Jira, so the Jira
credentials work, or set WHODAR_CONFLUENCE_URL, WHODAR_CONFLUENCE_EMAIL, and
WHODAR_CONFLUENCE_TOKEN:

    whodar index --source confluence --confluence-space ENG --confluence-space OPS

It reads page creators and last editors, weighted by labels, title words, and
space. Use --confluence-cql for a custom query.

## PagerDuty

Index services and on-call schedules to learn who answers for what. Create a
read-only API token in PagerDuty and export it:

    export WHODAR_PAGERDUTY_TOKEN=...
    whodar index --source pagerduty --merge

It reads every service and the people currently on call, giving each on-call
person the topics of the services they answer for.

## Git history

Index who actually commits to what. No tokens, no API: it reads local clones
directly, so it works for any repository you can `git clone`, including ones
with no CODEOWNERS file.

    whodar index --source git --repo-path ~/src/billing --repo-path ~/src/infra --merge

Each author gets the topics of the paths they touch, weighted by how often
they touch them, so the person doing the work outranks a drive-by. Authors
join other sources by commit email. Bot accounts such as dependabot are
skipped. `--git-since-days` bounds the window (default 365) and
`--max-commits` caps each repository (default 2000).

## Where your data lives

The index is written to `~/.whodar/index.json` by default, readable only by
your user. Override the location with `--data-dir`. This file holds the
indexed text, so treat it like the source data. It is never uploaded.

## Organization policy

The policy governs model egress and is enforced, not advisory. The default is
strict: answers are computed locally, and only the keyword resolver and a
local model are allowed. Indexing is separate from the policy: it talks only
to the sources you name, with your tokens, when you run it.

An organization pins behavior with a policy file at `/etc/whodar/policy.json`.
When that file sets `locked`, it wins over both the `--policy` flag and the
`WHODAR_POLICY_FILE` environment variable, so a user cannot point whodar at a
looser file. `WHODAR_POLICY_FILE` remains useful on unmanaged machines and in
tests. See `examples/policy.json`:

    {
      "mode": "strict",
      "locked": true,
      "private_channels": "deny"
    }

With the file above, `--policy open` is ignored and `--include-private` is
refused. The lock constrains the installed binary for regular users; it is
not a security boundary against an administrator. This is how a cautious
organization keeps a managed install locked down while an individual running
their own copy stays free to opt in.

## Updating the index

By default a new run replaces the index, so people who left the org or channels
that went away drop out and new ones appear. To combine sources instead, add
`--merge` and the run adds onto the existing index. People merge by email, so one
human stays one entry across the org chart, Slack, GitHub, Jira, Confluence,
PagerDuty, and code ownership.

Start with the org chart, then merge every other source onto it:

    whodar index --source org-csv --file people.csv
    whodar index --source slack --merge
    whodar index --source github --github-org your-org --merge
    whodar index --source jira --jira-project PROJ --merge
    whodar index --source confluence --confluence-space ENG --merge
    whodar index --source pagerduty --merge
    whodar ask "who knows the billing service"

Each run prints what joined and left since the last index, for example
"+3 people, -1 people, +1 channels". Add `--changes-file changes.json` to write
the full diff as JSON for a script or a report.

Re-indexing Jira, Confluence, GitHub, or Slack with `--merge` is incremental: it
fetches only what changed since the last run and folds it in, so a scheduled
refresh stays fast on a large tracker or workspace. A per-source watermark is
kept beside the index. Add `--full` to re-read everything and recompact, which
also picks up the few things an incremental run skips, such as a Slack message
edited after the window. Other sources always read in full.

## Joining one person across sources

People merge by email. When a source only knows a handle or an account id, such
as a GitHub login without a public email or a CODEOWNERS `@handle`, the same
human shows up as two entries. An alias file declares which identifiers belong
to the same person:

    {
      "alice@corp.com": ["github:alice", "codeowners:alice"]
    }

Pass it once with `--aliases` and the index joins the entries, including ones
indexed before the file existed:

    whodar index --source github --github-org your-org --merge --aliases aliases.json

The mapping is saved in the index, so later runs keep joining without the flag.
Joined identifiers appear in answers under `identities`, and a person's email
always wins as the display identifier. See `examples/aliases.json`.

## Recent activity counts more

Activity ages. Someone who owned a topic three years ago is usually the wrong
person to ask today, so dated records decay: a record loses half its weight per
half-life, 180 days by default. Slack messages, GitHub pull requests and
issues, Jira issues, and Confluence pages all carry their activity date. The
org chart, CODEOWNERS, and PagerDuty on-call describe the present and never
decay.

Tune it at index time:

    whodar index --source slack --merge --half-life-days 90

A shorter half-life favors the people active right now; `--half-life-days 0`
turns decay off entirely.

## Sealing a finding for someone outside the team

When a knowledge-risk finding has to hold up in front of a board, an auditor,
or an acquirer, seal it:

    whodar attest > finding.loomseal.json

The bundle carries the claim, a digest of the evidence behind it, and an
ed25519 signature over a tamper-evident chain. Anyone can verify it offline,
with no account and nothing sent anywhere:

    loomseal verify finding.loomseal.json
    whodar attest verify finding.loomseal.json

The first proves the bundle is intact; the second judges the licensing chain
inside it. A licensed install whose license names its sealing key (send the
`sealing key` line from `whodar license status` when requesting a license)
produces seals that are provably issued to the organization. Unlicensed runs
seal too, marked as evaluations inside the signature. Keys are published at
whodar.dev/verify.

- `whodar version` prints the version.

Shared flags: `--data-dir` sets the index location, `--policy` sets the egress
mode, `--pretty` indents JSON. Set `WHODAR_INDEX_KEY` (base64 of 32 random bytes)
or `WHODAR_INDEX_PASSPHRASE` to encrypt the index and episodes at rest.

## Scale

The index and its embeddings load fully into memory to answer a question, so
size scales with people and, when `--embed` is set, with the vector dimension.
A few thousand people is comfortable on a laptop; embeddings roughly multiply the
file size, so a large org that wants semantic search should expect an index in
the hundreds of megabytes and size the serving host accordingly. `whodar status`
reports the current people and source counts.
