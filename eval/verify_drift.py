"""Check ownership-drift findings against the history, not against whodar.

whodar eval scores ranking against declared ownership, but it reads the same
index the finding came from, so it cannot say whether a finding is TRUE. This
reads raw git and nothing else, and asks one question of each reported area: is
the person whodar names also the one who has worked in that area most?

Two exclusions, both learned the hard way. Bots are not people. And a commit
touching a large part of the tree is a codemod rather than ownership: counting
those made every finding look wrong, because the sweep authors appear
everywhere.
